### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Tarun**](https://taruncodesfr.github.io/taruncodes-portfolio), a design engineer based in Germany.

I design and build whatever I can imagine.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is react, typescript, tailwind, and framer motion. My favorite tools are excalidraw, and obsidion to structure the app i'm heading to create.

I’ve built over less public repos, but privately.. it’s probably more than 100 at this point.
